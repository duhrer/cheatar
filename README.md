# The "Cheater's Guitar"

This project is a software synth built with [Flocking](http://flockingjs.org/). When a note is played on a connected MIDI controller, it plays a guitar-like chord.

The software synth provided by this package is designed for use either with WebMIDI (at the moment, only supported fully by Chrome), or with Node.js.
